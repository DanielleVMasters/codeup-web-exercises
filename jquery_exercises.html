<h1 id="title">Can't I Even Dream? Lyrics</h1>
<p id="lyrics" class="codeup">Desperate and so lonely, I've looked for you.
    And left behind all that I had ever longed for.
    Cold winds scream through my ears like a banshee.
    A freezing chill- A pain that still will forever haunt me.

    Yet I have made it here
    Running through all the fear.
    The sadness in my heart retains the pain.
    And if I fall, I've learned
    That I may not return.
    None of my love remains.

    Yet I have made it here.
    Make this pain disappear.
    My one and only, Prince Charming.
    And still I wonder, why can't I even dream?

    Tears fall like a rainstorm I barely see.
    A twisted grin broken within. Am I going crazy?

    Yet I have made it here
    Bearing this love, my dear.
    Bearing the weight of it upon my knees.
    And if I scream your name
    It's not returned in same
    I bed, forget me please.

    Yet I have made it here.
    Make this pain disappear.
    My one and only, Prince Charming.

    (And still I wonder, why can't I even dream?)
    And still I wonder, why can't I even dream?</p>
